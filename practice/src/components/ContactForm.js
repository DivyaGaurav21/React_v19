// Building forms is a common task in Front End. In this exercise, we will build a basic "Contact Us" form, 
// commonly seen on marketing websites for visitors to ask questions or provide feedback.

// Requirements
// -----------//
// The form should contain the following elements:
// Name field
// Email field
// Message field. Since the message can be long, using a <textarea> will be more suitable.
// Submit button
// Contains the text "Send".
// Clicking on the submit button submits the form.
// The form and submission should be implemented mostly in HTML.
// There is no need to do any client-side validation on the fields. Validation will be done on the server side.
// Submission API
// Upon submission, POST the form data to https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/questions/contact-form with the following
//  fields in the request body: name, email, message.

// If all the form fields are correctly filled up, you will see an alert containing a success message. Congratulations!
// Notes
// You do not really need JavaScript for this question, the focus is on HTML form validation and submission.
